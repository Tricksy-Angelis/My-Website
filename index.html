        <h2>ðŸ“œ Manifesto</h2>
        <p>
          Every night, as we slip beneath the surface of consciousness, our minds transport us into a world of stories, emotions, images, and sensations.
        </p>

        <p>
          These strange mental experiences â€” dreams â€” have fascinated philosophers, scientists, and storytellers for centuries.
        </p>

        <p>
          While ancient civilizations believed dreams were messages from the divine or glimpses into the future, modern neuroscience is gradually uncovering the intricate biological and psychological mechanisms that shape our nightly narratives.

        <h2>What's the logic here?</h2>

        <p>
          At the heart of dreaming lies a stage of sleep known as REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep.
        </p>

        <h2>But what is REM?</h2>

        <p>
          During REM, which typically begins about 90 minutes after you fall asleep, the brain becomes incredibly active â€” almost as active as when you're awake â€” even though your body is temporarily paralyzed. Itâ€™s during this phase that most vivid, emotionally charged dreams occur.

        <h3>Neurologically,</h3>
        <p>
          Dreams emerge from a delicate interplay between several brain regions.
        </p>
        <h3>The Amygdala</h3>
        <p>
          processes emotions like fear and pleasure, is highly active during REM sleep, which may explain why many dreams feel intense or surreal.
        </p>
        <h3>Meanwhile,</h3>
        <p>
          The prefrontal cortex, responsible for logic and decision-making, becomes much less active â€” which is why even the most illogical dream scenarios often feel perfectly normal until we wake up. This suspension of rationality allows our subconscious to take the lead, resulting in dreams that range from magical to nightmarish.
