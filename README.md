#  3D Scroll Animation Website with Three.js

Welcome to my beginner-level web project! This is a **3D scroll animation website** built using **Three.js**, a powerful JavaScript library for 3D graphics in the browser. The goal of this project was to learn the fundamentals of Three.js and explore how scrolling can be used to trigger dynamic, interactive 3D animations on a webpage.

## Features

- Smooth scroll-triggered 3D animations
- Interactive camera movements based on scroll position
- Clean and responsive UI built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Beginner-friendly code and structure for learning purposes

## Purpose of the Project

This project was created as part of my learning journey in web development. I wanted to experiment with **WebGL** and learn how to combine **scroll-based interactivity** with 3D elements. Three.js gave me the flexibility to create visually engaging effects without diving too deep into raw WebGL.

## Built With

- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/)
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Vanilla JavaScript

## What I Learned

- Basics of setting up a Three.js scene, camera, and renderer
- How to animate objects using scroll events
- Implementing simple 3D object transformations (rotation, position, scale)
- Connecting user input (scrolling) to camera movement and animation flow

## Future Improvements

- Add navigation and multiple sections
- Include more complex 3D models or geometries
- Add loading screen for better UX
- Optimize for mobile responsiveness
